	abstract = {The human brain is organized in functional modules. Such an organization presents a basic conundrum: Modules ought to be sufficiently independent to guarantee functional specialization and sufficiently connected to bind multiple processors for efficient information transfer. It is commonly accepted that small-world architecture of short paths and large local clustering may solve this problem. However, there is intrinsic tension between shortcuts generating small worlds and the persistence of modularity, a global property unrelated to local clustering. Here, we present a possible solution to this puzzle. We first show that a modified percolation theory can define a set of hierarchically organized modules made of strong links in functional brain networks. These modules are “large-world” self-similar structures and, therefore, are far from being small-world. However, incorporating weaker ties to the network converts it into a small world preserving an underlying backbone of well-defined modules. Remarkably, weak ties are precisely organized as predicted by theory maximizing information transfer with minimal wiring cost. This trade-off architecture is reminiscent of the “strength of weak ties” crucial concept of social networks. Such a design suggests a natural solution to the paradox of efficient information flow in the highly modular structure of the brain.},

Considerable attention has been recently devoted to this problem, with the finding that many real networks are self-similar fractals. Here we present, compare and study in detail a number of algorithms that we have used in previous papers towards this goal. We show that this problem can be mapped to the well-known graph colouring problem and then we simply can apply well-established algorithms. This seems to be the most efficient method, but we also present two other algorithms based on burning which provide a number of other benefits. We argue that the algorithms presented provide a solution close to optimal and that another algorithm that can significantly improve this result in an efficient way does not exist. We offer to anyone that finds such a method to cover his/her expenses for a one-week trip to our lab in New York (details in http://jamlab.org [http://jamlab.org] ).},

	abstract = {Complex networks have been studied extensively owing to their relevance to many real systems such as the world-wide web, the Internet, energy landscapes and biological and social networks1,2,3,4,5. A large number of real networks are referred to as ‘scale-free’ because they show a power-law distribution of the number of links per node1,6,7. However, it is widely believed that complex networks are not invariant or self-similar under a length-scale transformation. This conclusion originates from the ‘small-world’ property of these networks, which implies that the number of nodes increases exponentially with the ‘diameter’ of the network8,9,10,11, rather than the power-law relation expected for a self-similar structure. Here we analyse a variety of real complex networks and find that, on the contrary, they consist of self-repeating patterns on all length scales. This result is achieved by the application of a renormalization procedure that coarse-grains the system into boxes containing nodes within a given ‘size’. We identify a power-law relation between the number of boxes needed to cover the network and the size of the box, defining a finite self-similar exponent. These fundamental properties help to explain the scale-free nature of complex networks and suggest a common self-organization dynamics.},

	abstract = {This book presents a new economic theory developed from physical and biological principles. It explains how technology, social systems and economic values are intimately related to resources. Many people have recognized that mainstream (neoclassical) economic theories are not consistent with physical laws and often not consistent with empirical patterns, but most feel that economic activities are too complex to be described by a simple and coherent mathematical theory. While social systems are indeed complex, all life systems, including social systems, satisfy two principles. First, all systems need to extract resources from the external environment to compensate for their consumption. Second, for a system to be viable, the amount of resource extraction has to be no less than the level of consumption. From these two principles, we derive a quantitative theory of major factors in economic activities, such as fixed cost, variable cost, discount rate, uncertainty and duration. The mathematical theory enables us to systematically measure the effectiveness of different policies and institutional structures at varying levels of resource abundance and cost.The theory presented in this book shows that there do not exist universally optimal policies or institutional structures. Instead, the impacts of different policies or social structures have to be measured within the context of existing levels of resource abundance. As the physical costs of extracting resources rise steadily, many policy assumptions adopted in mainstream economic theories, and workable in times of cheap and abundant energy supplies and other resources, need to be reconsidered. In this rapidly changing world, the theory presented here provides a solid foundation for examining the long-term impacts of today's policy decisions.},

	abstract = {"Hidalgo has made a bold attempt to synthesize a large body of cutting-edge work into a readable, slender volume. This is the future of growth theory." --Financial TimesWhat is economic growth? And why, historically, has it occurred in only a few places? Previous efforts to answer these questions have focused on institutions, geography, finances, and psychology. But according to MIT's antidisciplinarian César Hidalgo, understanding the nature of economic growth demands transcending the social sciences and including the natural sciences of information, networks, and complexity. To understand the growth of economies, Hidalgo argues, we first need to understand the growth of order.At first glance, the universe seems hostile to order. Thermodynamics dictates that over time, order-or information-disappears. Whispers vanish in the wind just like the beauty of swirling cigarette smoke collapses into disorderly clouds. But thermodynamics also has loopholes that promote the growth of information in pockets. Although cities are all pockets where information grows, they are not all the same. For every Silicon Valley, Tokyo, and Paris, there are dozens of places with economies that accomplish little more than pulling rocks out of the ground. So, why does the US economy outstrip Brazil's, and Brazil's that of Chad? Why did the technology corridor along Boston's Route 128 languish while Silicon Valley blossomed? In each case, the key is how people, firms, and the networks they form make use of information.Seen from Hidalgo's vantage, economies become distributed computers, made of networks of people, and the problem of economic development becomes the problem of making these computers more powerful. By uncovering the mechanisms that enable the growth of information in nature and society, Why Information Grows lays bear the origins of physical order and economic growth. Situated at the nexus of information theory, physics, sociology, and economics, this book propounds a new theory of how economies can do not just more things, but more interesting things.},

Rather it is always set in the I context of decisions about what type of system is to be sustained and over what spatiotemporal scale. :rhere is a duality of the material system itself, as opposed to human frameworks for communication or management action. Exclusive focus on the material system gives the decision-maker an impossible number of choices, and no definitions; exclusive focus on scale and type gives narrowly directe.d capricious action that ignores lessons from the material system. An ide,al is guided by the principal physical and biological material flows, as the scientist erects a rich system definition that explicitly links different types of system, like landscape and ecosystem, across a range of scales, in a coherent complex management scheme. Sustainability is not a matter of degree, because the material imbalances of incomplete sustainability will bring all down like the ancient failure of Sumerian agriculture through salination. True, sustaining at one scale may deny sustainability at another, but if it is in a scale- explicit framework, trade-offs can be calculated and weighed. Sustainability must work with natural processes, but they are not those of the pristine system. Rather management must accommodate to new structures and their patterns of process which naturally emerge far from equilibrium as a result of a substantial human presence. In a world with 5 billion people, managing towards a pristine system is irresponsible.},

This system is internally inconsistent, which determines its ability to develop continuously in a spontaneous manner for a long geologic time, leading to the formation of principally new mineral phases and geochemical types of water. Within the Earth's crust, this system persistently develops in a nonlinear field of the thermodynamic branch under the conditions far from equilibrium; it is capable of accumulating the solar energy and forms abiogenic dissipative structures playing a special role in the progressive development of inert matter and then of living matter. The inclination of this system to the progressive self-organization defines it as one of the fundamental and basic system in the development of inorganic matter. From this system there was a set of others having inherited most of its properties. The evolution of the water-rock system led to the formation of secondary mineral phases and new geochemical types of water, and as these increased, the system gradually became more complex in composition and structure and formed new geochemical media which, in turn, control the formation of new mineral phases having effect on the characteristics of the media. This process is geologically perpetual. This is the essence of self-organization in mineral kingdom, including initiation, growth and spatial-temporal dispersal of new structural forms, mineral and geochemical media formations, and finally, the origination of new organic substances and life.},

They conclude that the only similarity between the two is their ability to lead to the emergent property of spatial variation from a homogeneous background. There is a well-developed theory for the equilibrium case involving the order parameter concept, which leads to a strong correlation of the order parameter over macroscopic distances in the broken symmetry phase (as exists, for example, in a ferromagnetic domain). This correlation endows the structure with a self-scaled stability, rigidity, autonomy, or permanence. In contrast, the authors assert that there is no developed theory of dissipative structures (despite claims to the contrary) and that perhaps there are no stable dissipative structures at all! Symmetry-breaking effects such as vortices and convection cells in fluids—effects that result from dynamic instability bifurcations—are considered to be unstable and transitory, rather than stable dissipative structures.Thus, the authors do not believe that speculation about dissipative structures and their broken symmetries can, at present, be relevent to questions of the origin and persistence of life. —The Editor},

The second law suggests that, in systems moved away from equilibrium, processes can emerge so that the system organizes in a way that reduces the effect of the applied gradient. If dynamic and or kinetic conditions permit, self organization processes can be expected. As biosystems grow and develop, they should increase their total dissipation, and develop more complex structures with more energy flow, increase their cycling activity, develop greater diversity and generate more hierarchical levels. As a corollary to this general statement, biosystems which do not increase their total dissipation, are organisms dedicated to death, like observed during the aging of any biosystem. Species which survive in ecosystems are those that funnel energy into their own production and reproduction and contribute to autocatalytic processes which increase the total dissipation of the ecosystem while at same time surviving within the constraints of their changing environment. In a broad class of biosystems, stress and aging have similar thermodynamic properties and suggests common underlying principles.},

Herein, I analyze some aspects of self-organization in metabolic processes utilizing information theory to quantifying biomolecular information flows in bits, an approach that enables the visualization of emergent effective connectivity structures. Specifically, I determined the emergent functional integrative processes arising from irreversible enzymatic steps in yeast glycolysis, and in the systemic metabolic structure. Experimental observations and numerical studies with dissipative metabolic networks have shown that enzymatic activity can spontaneously self-organize leading to the emergence of a systemic metabolic structure, characterized by a set of different enzymatic reactions always locked into active states, i.e., the metabolic core, while the remaining catalytic processes are intermittently active. This global metabolic structure was verified in Escherichia coli, Helicobacter pylori, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and it seems to be a common key feature for all cells. The observed effective connectivity in both the irreversible enzymatic steps of yeast glycolysis and the systemic metabolic structure is highly dynamic and characterized by significant variations of biomolecular causality flows. These effective connectivity flows reflect the integration of catalytic processes within multienzymatic systems, and their functional coordination. The resulting functional integrative structures appear to be fundamental motifs in the dissipative self-organization and self-regulation of cellular metabolism.},

Two major advancements are catastrophe theory and nonequilibrium thermodynamics with its associated theory of self-organization. These theories indicate that complex system development is nonlinear, discontinuous (catastrophes), not predictable (bifurcations), and multivalued (multiple developmental pathways). Ecosystem development should be expected to exhibit these characteristics.Traditional ecological theory has attempted to describe ecosystem stress response using some simple notions such as stability and resiliency. In fact, stress-response must be characterized by a richer set of concepts. The ability of the system to maintain its current operating point in the face of the stress, must be ascertained. If the system changes operating points, there are several questions to be considered: Is the change along the original developmental pathway or a new one? Is the change organizing or disorganizing? Will the system return to its original state? Will the system flip to some new state in a catastrophic way? Is the change acceptable to humans?The integrity of an ecosystem does not reflect a single characteristic of an ecosystem. The concept of integrity must be seen as multidimensional and encompassing a rich set of ecosystem behaviors. A framework of concepts for discussing integrity is presented in this article.},

	abstract = {Previous studies suggest that food-web theory has yet to account for major differences in food-web properties of marine versus other types of ecosystems. We examined this issue by analyzing the network structure of food webs for the Northeast US
Shelf, a Caribbean reef, and Benguela, off South Africa. The values of connectance (links per species2), link density (links per species), mean chain length, and fractions of intermediate, omnivorous, and cannibalistic taxa of these marine
webs are somewhat high but still within the ranges observed in other webs. We further compared the marine webs by using the empirically corroborated niche model that accounts for observed variation in diversity (taxon number) and complexity
(connectance). Our results substantiate previously reported results for estuarine, fresh-water, and terrestrial datasets, which suggests that food webs from different types of ecosystems with variable diversity and complexity share fundamental structural
and ordering characteristics. Analyses of potential secondary extinctions resulting from species loss show that the structural robustness of marine food webs is also consistent with trends from other food webs. As expected, given their relatively high
connectance, marine food webs appear fairly robust to loss of most-connected taxa as well as random taxa. Still, the short average path length between marine taxa (1.6 links) suggests that effects from perturbations, such as overfishing, can be
transmitted more widely throughout marine ecosystems than previously appreciated.},
