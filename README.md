### Jevon's Paradox

*"Jevons’ paradox (F. Jevons, 1990; Mayumi et al. 1998; Alcott, 2005) was first enunciated by Jevons in his 1865 book The Coal Question (W.S. Jevons, 1865). Briefly it states that an increase in output/input ratio – the “efficiency” in using a resource - leads, in the medium/long term, to an increased use of that resource rather than to a reduction. At that time, Jevons was discussing possible trends of future consumption of coal and reacting to scenarios advocated by technological optimists. In fact, the contemporary of Jevons were urging to dramatically increase the “efficiency” of engines in order to reduce coal consumption. In face of such a claim, Jevons correctly indicated that more efficient engines would have expanded the possible uses of coal for human activities. Therefore increases in efficiency would have boosted the rate of consumption of existing coal reserves rather than reducing it . . . Jevons’ paradox has different names and different applications: “rebound effect” in energy literature and “paradox of prevention” in relation to public health. In the latter case, the paradox consists of the fact that the amount of money “saved” by prevention of a few targeted diseases leads to a dramatic increase in the overall bill of the health sector in the long-term.”
